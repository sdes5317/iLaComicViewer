# iLaComicViewer

## Feature
1. Basic Image Viewing Functionality
2. Support for Japanese and Korean Manga Formats
3. Automatic Image Adaptation to Window Size
4. **Maximizing User Experience: Utilize memory caching to replace delayed loading.**

The fourth point is the development objective of this project. Many comic software applications often prioritize performance optimization by employing delayed loading, which often leads to subpar experiences for users who desire quick browsing.
